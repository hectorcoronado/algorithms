1. Whiteboard a function called `compare` that compares two numbers. The function should return `1` if the first number is greater than the second, `0` if they are equal, or `-1` if the first number is less than the second.    

    How many calculations does your function do?
    What is the Big O time complexity of your function?


2. Whiteboard a function to find the middle element in an array.  What is the Big O time complexity of your function?

3. Whiteboard a function to find the maximum element in an array. What is the Big O time complexity of your function? Using Big O notation, how much extra space does your function require (not counting the space used for the input array)?

4. Whiteboard a function called `indexOf` that takes in a number and an array and searches for the number in the array. If the number is in the array, it should return the array index where it found the number. If the number is not in the array, it should return `null`.  What is the Big O time complexity of your function?

5. Whiteboard a function called `countNums` that takes in an array of numbers and counts how many times each number in the array appears.  What is the Big O time complexity of your function? Using Big O notation, how much extra space does your function require (not counting the space used for the input array)?


6. Whiteboard a function called `findShared` that takes in two arrays and outputs a new array that contains every number appearing in both input arrays. What is the Big O time complexity of your function? Using Big O notation, how much extra space does your function require (not counting the space used for the input array)?
