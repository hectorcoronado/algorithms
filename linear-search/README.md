#Linear Search

1. Passing in an array to `linearSearch(arr, target)`, we determine that the maximum number of times the for-loop can run is *n*, where *n* is equal to `arr.length` and this worst case occurs when the value being searched for is not present in the array.
2. The worst-case running time of linear search grows with the array size *n*. The notation we use for this running time is:
> `Θ(n)`

3. This is highly inefficient and otherwise known as:
> `big-Θ notation `
